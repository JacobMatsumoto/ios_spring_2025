/*
structures to hold burger toppings, 
optionals to hold nil values for if people don't pick toppings
variables for toppings

set up stucture for the different burgers
give them things like, kind of bun, temp(well done, medium, rare, etc), lettuce, onion, tomato, mayo, pickle
set those vairables as optionals so if they aren't picked they're nil and dont crash the program.
