// i'll need 
// variables to hold seconds, minutes hours
// a while loop to run while the clock is on
// a stipulation of how to increment time properly ???(I dont know how yet)
//an if statement to increment 60 seconds to 1 min and 60 min to 1 hr and to reset if we hit 24 hrs
//a way to not have an infinite loop that makes the computer angry and explode.

//recipe would be implementing the above tools in the right order


//I did that wrong but I dont want to delete it
//ingredients:if statements, while loops, variables to change += ops, true false booleans.
//instructions:set variables. set the start of the clock with the while.
//implement if statements for if a minute is reached set seconds to 0 and += minutes by 1
//same for minutes to hours.
//display time
